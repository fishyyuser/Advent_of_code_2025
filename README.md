# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 — Python Solutions

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2025** repository!  
This repo contains my Python solutions for this year’s Advent of Code challenges, focusing on clarity, efficiency, and clean problem-solving.

---

## 🧩 Goals

- Write clean and Pythonic solutions
- Strengthen algorithmic problem-solving skills
- Maintain a consistent structure across all days
- Keep solutions lightweight and readable

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

```bash
aoc2025/
├── day01/
│ ├── part1.py
│ ├── part2.py
│ └── input.txt
├── day02/
├── ...
└── day12/

```

Each day contains:

- `part1.py` — solution for Part 1
- `part2.py` — solution for Part 2
- `input.txt` — puzzle input

---

## 🚀 Running Solutions

Navigate into any `dayXX` directory and run:

```bash
python part1.py
python part2.py
```

All solutions use **Python 3.13.9**

---

## 🛠️ Python Techniques

- Itertools & collections
- Efficient parsing and data handling
- Recursion and memoization when needed
- Greedy, graph search, dynamic programming (if applicable)
- Pythonic comprehensions and generators
