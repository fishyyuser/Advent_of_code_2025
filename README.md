# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 — Python Solutions

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2025** repository!  
This repo contains my Python solutions for this year’s Advent of Code challenges, focusing on clarity, efficiency, and clean problem-solving.

---

## 🧩 Goals

- Write clean and Pythonic solutions
- Strengthen algorithmic problem-solving skills
- Maintain a consistent structure across all days
- Keep solutions lightweight and readable

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

```bash
Advent_of_code_2025/
├── aoc/
│   ├── day01/
│   │   ├── part1.py
│   │   ├── part2.py
│   │   └── input.txt
│   ├── day02/
│   ├── ...
│   └── day12/
│
└── utils/
    ├── common.py
    └── __init__.py
```

Each day contains:

- `part1.py` — solution for Part 1
- `part2.py` — solution for Part 2
- `input.txt` — puzzle input
- (the input helpers live inside `aoc/utils/common.py`)

---

## 🚀 Running Solutions

From the **project root**, run any day using module execution:

```bash
python -m aoc.day01.part1
python -m aoc.day01.part2
```

This ensures:

- correct imports (`from aoc.utils.common import read_lines`)
- correct `input.txt` path resolution
- consistent behavior on all systems

All solutions use **Python 3.11.14**.

## 🛠️ Python Techniques

- Itertools & collections
- Efficient parsing and data handling
- Recursion and memoization when needed
- Greedy, graph search, dynamic programming (if applicable)
- Pythonic comprehensions and generators
